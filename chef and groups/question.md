# Chef and Groups
## https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/1-star-difficulty-problems/DIFF1200/problems/GROUPS
There are `N` seats in a row. You are given a string `S` with length `N`; for each valid `i`, the `i`-th character of `S` is `'0'` if the `i`-th seat is empty or `'1'` if there is someone sitting in that seat.

Two people are friends if they are sitting next to each other. Two friends are always part of the same group of friends.

Can you find the total number of groups?

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer `T` denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string `S`.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of groups.

## Constraints

```text
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
```

## Sample Input

```text
4
000
010
101
01011011011110
```

## Sample Output

```text
0
1
2
4
```

## Explanation

**Example case 1:** Since all seats are empty, the number of groups is `0`.

**Example case 2:** Since only one seat is occupied, the number of groups is `1`.

**Example case 3:** Here, two seats are occupied, but since they are not adjacent, the people sitting on them belong to different groups.

**Example case 4:** Here, we have `4` groups of friends with size `1`, `2`, `2` and `4` respectively. That is, first group is sitting at `2`nd seat, second group at `4`th and `5`th seat, third group at `7`th and `8`th seat and fourth group at `10`th to `13`th seat.
