# Balanced Reversals

Chef is given a binary string `A` of length `N`. He can perform the following operation on `A` any number of times:

Choose `L` and `R` (`1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N`), such that, in the substring `A[L,R]`, the number of `1`s is equal to the number of `0`s and reverse the substring `A[L,R]`.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that Chef can obtain after performing the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times on `A`.

String `X` is lexicographically smaller than string `Y`, if either of the following satisfies:

- `X` is a prefix of `Y` and `X ≠ Y`.
- There exists an index `i` such that `Xi < Yi` and `Xj = Yj` for all `1 ≤ j < i`.

## Input Format

First line will contain `T`, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Each test case contains two lines.

- The first line contains the integer `N`, the length of the binary string.
- The second line contains the binary string `A`.

## Output Format

For each test case, print the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be obtained after performing the operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

## Constraints

```text
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
```

## Sample Input

```text
2
5
01100
4
0000
```

## Sample Output

```text
00011
0000
```

## Explanation

Test Case 1: Chef can choose `L = 2` and `R = 5`. The chosen substring, `A[2,5] = 1100`. On reversing this, we get `0011`. Thus, the final string is `A = 00011`. Note that this is the lexicographically smallest string possible.

Test Case 2: Since the string is already lexicographically minimum, Chef does not need to apply any operation.
