# Train Partner
##https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/1-star-difficulty-problems/DIFF1200/problems/ANKTRAIN?tab=statement
Rahul and Rashi are off to the wedding of a close relative. This time they have to travel without their guardians. Rahul got very interested in the arrangement of seats inside the train coach.

The entire coach could be viewed as an arrangement of consecutive blocks of size 8.

| Berth Number | Compartment |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1 - 8 | 1 |
| 9 - 16 | 2 |
| 17 - 24 | 3 |
| ... | ... |

Each of these size-8 blocks are further arranged as:

```text
1LB, 2MB, 3UB, 4LB, 5MB, 6UB, 7SL, 8SU
9LB, 10MB, ...
...
```

Here **LB** denotes Lower Berth, **MB** denotes Middle Berth and **UB** denotes Upper Berth.

The following berths are called **Train-Partners**:

```text
3UB | 6UB
2MB | 5MB
1LB | 4LB
7SL | 8SU
```

and the pattern is repeated for every set of 8 berths.

Rahul and Rashi are playing this game of finding the train partner of each berth. Can you write a program to do the same?

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer `T`, denoting the number of test cases to follow.
- Each of the next `T` lines contain a single integer `N`, the berth number whose neighbor is to be found out.

## Output

The output should contain exactly `T` lines each containing the berth of the neighbor of the corresponding seat.

## Constraints

### Subtask #1 (50 points)

```text
1 ≤ T ≤ 8
1 ≤ N ≤ 8
```

### Subtask #2 (50 points)

```text
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
```

## Sample Input

```text
3
1
5
3
```

## Sample Output

```text
4LB
2MB
6UB
```
